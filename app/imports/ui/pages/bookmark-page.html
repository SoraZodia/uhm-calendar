        <h2>The Elder Scrolls IV</h2>
        <p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and
          published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take-Two Interactive division 2K Games. Oblivion was released on
          March
          20, 2006, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, and later for mobile phones and PlayStation 3. In the main
          storyline, the player character thwarts the fanatical Mythic Dawn cult from opening the gates to a realm
          called Oblivion. The player can travel anywhere in the game world at any time, develop the character's
          skills,
          and ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. The graphics were designed with an improved Havok
          physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, and procedural content generation tools to generate terrain.
          The
          Radiant A.I. system manages the complex behaviors of the non-player characters (NPCs). The game features the
          music of award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Overall, Oblivion has been successful both commercially and
          critically, winning industry and publication awards. It was praised for its graphics, expansive game world,
          and fully voiced, schedule-driven NPCs. </p>
