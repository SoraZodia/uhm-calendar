        <h2>The Elder Scrolls IV</h2>
        <p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and
          published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take-Two Interactive division 2K Games. Oblivion was released on
          March
          20, 2006, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, and later for mobile phones and PlayStation 3. In the main
          storyline, the player character thwarts the fanatical Mythic Dawn cult from opening the gates to a realm
          called Oblivion. The player can travel anywhere in the game world at any time, develop the character's
          skills,
          and ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. The graphics were designed with an improved Havok
          physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, and procedural content generation tools to generate terrain.
          The
          Radiant A.I. system manages the complex behaviors of the non-player characters (NPCs). The game features the
          music of award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Overall, Oblivion has been successful both commercially and
          critically, winning industry and publication awards. It was praised for its graphics, expansive game world,
          and fully voiced, schedule-driven NPCs. </p>

        <h2>Keeper of the Archives</h2>
        <p>The position of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford in England dates from 1634, when it was
          established by new statutes for the university brought in by William Laud (Archbishop of Canterbury and
          Chancellor of the University). The first holder of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of the
          archives in 1631 as part of the preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives
          as
          a
          reward for his work. The archives were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower
          of
          the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards
          built
          at that time are still in use. The archives include charters, title deeds, university registers and records,
          and
          other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep
          their
          own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no
          sound
          or
          video recordings. In total, 21 people have held the position.</p>

        <h2>Panaeolus semiovatus var. semiovatus</h2>
        <p>Panaeolus semiovatus var. semiovatus is a medium-sized buff-colored mushroom that grows on horse dung and
          has
          black spores. It is widely distributed and is present in many temperate zones of the world. While some
          guides
          list
          this species as edible, a few people experience gastric upset after consumption.</p>
